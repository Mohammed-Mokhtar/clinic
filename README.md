## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Implementation

This project showcases a professional workflow using modern front-end tools and frameworks:

### 1. Bootstrap 5 Framework
* **Grid System:** Utilized Bootstrap's powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build complex, responsive layouts with minimal custom CSS.
* **Utility Classes:** Leveraged spacing, typography, and color utilities to maintain consistency and speed up the styling process.
* **Pre-built Components:** Integrated and customized Bootstrap components such as Navbars, Buttons, and Forms for a polished, reliable UI.

### 2. Custom CSS Architecture (`style.css`)
* **Component Overrides:** Developed custom CSS to override Bootstrap defaults, ensuring the project aligns with unique branding requirements while maintaining the framework's structural integrity.
* **Advanced Styling:** Implemented custom animations, hover effects, and decorative elements that go beyond standard framework capabilities.
* **Variable Usage:** Maintained a consistent design language through strategic use of CSS variables for colors and spacing.

### 3. Responsive Web Design (RWD)
* **Mobile-First Approach:** The UI is designed to be fully functional on mobile devices first and scales elegantly to tablets and large desktops.
* **Responsive Breakpoints:** Fine-tuned the user experience across all standard device widths using Bootstrap’s built-in breakpoints.

### 4. Semantic HTML5 & SEO
* **Accessibility:** Used semantic HTML tags to ensure the content is accessible to screen readers and optimized for search engine indexing.
* **Clean Structure:** Organized the document into logical sections (Header, Hero, Features, Footer) for better maintainability and readability.
